                                    <p> Training is how your model learns to predict the correct labels from your examples. You can think of your examples as a collection of flashcards. During training, your model will continually look through the flashcards and try to find similar patterns that help it guess the right answers. </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Imported images to<span>label as examples</span></li>
                                        <li>At least two labels</li>

                                    <p>Lobe will also follow best practices to continue training when you make changes to your examples. If you make large changes or add/remove labels, Lobe will reset training and start training a new model. </p>

                                    <p>After automatic training has completed, you can manually optimize your model to train for longer for better real-world performance <span> (File > Optimize Model). </span></p>

                                    <p> Training time is quite variable and depends on how hard it is to distinguish between the labels in your examples and how many examples you have. It can take anywhere from minutes to hours, and sometimes days for very large problems. </p>

                                    <p> You can hover over the training progress to see a time estimate. This training time estimate is updated every few seconds based on your progress and computerâ€™s current processing speed. You may see it fluctuate if you are performing other tasks on your computer as available CPU and memory change. </p>

                                    <p> Your examples are your modelâ€™s source of truth about the world. Here are some best practices for building successful projects: </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li> Understand your problem - start simple, expand over time. Break your scenario down into smaller experiments to prototype and then expand over time.</li>
                                        <li> Lobe only learns from the examples you import. Try to collect examples that cover the different types of images your model will see and make predictions on in the future. </li>
                                        <li> More images always help - new and unique images are better. The more unique and different the images are, the better your model will learn to generalize.</li>
                                        <li> If you canâ€™t classify the label from looking at an image, it will also be difficult for Lobe. Make the image content as large and relevant to your label as possible.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p> Compare the images in Use with the images in your examples: </p>

                                        <li> Your model may have memorized your examples instead of learning to generalize to new images. This is commonly called overfitting. Check <a href="">Results</a> to see if your model is overfitting. </li>
                                        <li> These new images are not represented by your examples. Try to play with edge cases and â€˜trickâ€™ Lobe as much as possible. Make sure your examples contain all these new variations and conditions seen from Use.

                                    <p>Lobe will always predict one of your labels even if your image does not contain any related content. If you expect your model to see these types of images, create a <span>â€˜Noneâ€™</span> label and add variations of these images as examples. You can use this â€˜Noneâ€™ label as a placeholder when waiting for relevant predictions.</p>
